# EDAsignalAnalysis
Python script for EDA signal preprocess and analysis. Uses Neurokit2 functions for filtering, artifact detection and  parameters calculation. 
Neurokit function eda_preprocess extracts from the raw signal the SCL and SCR, detects the peaks in the signal and returns their aplitude, latency, peak onset, peak rise time
The spectral power of the signal and AUC were also calculated.
